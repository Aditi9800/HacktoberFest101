    It's already Tuesday and holidays are taking over me. I have been acting lazy all day and procastinating every task. Afterall, 
    it is holidays and I am back at home. Today, it's Navmi, the last day of Durga Puja, the festival and inspite of being in
    Varanasi, the city of temples, I haven't seen a single Pandal decoration. It's is also due to lack of company cause all my friends
    are back home.
    
    Since, I am at home, my mom has started treating me like Black hole, like I can eat and eat. She is giving me tasty dishes 
    on dishes, which is good, but it's too much and making me lazy and fall asleep.

    I woke up at 7:30 PM and suddenly got a call from my best friend that she coming to pick me up for the tour. It was raining 
    very lightly on the street, the contrasting effects of lights on street makes it all feel moody and surreal. We enjoyed the 
    together and ate too much. That moment i felt enough, thankful and greatful at the same time. I realised how even your small 
    efforts and initiatives can make a huge impact upon your and others life.
